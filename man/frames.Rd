\title{Average Marginal Effects}
\usage{
frames(data, formula, family, ci_type = "perc", boot = 100, ci = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the data frame containing the variables for the model}

\item{formula}{the model formula}

\item{family}{the family of the glm (e.g., binomial, poisson)}

\item{ci_type}{the type of boostrapped confidence interval; options are "perc", "basic", "bca"}

\item{boot}{the number of bootstrapped samples; default is 100}

\item{ci}{the confidence interval; the default is .975 which is the 95\% confidence interval.}
}
\description{
Provides the average marginal effects of a GLM model with 
bootstrapped confidence intervals.
}
\details{
Using the average marginal effects as discussed by Tamas Bartus (2005), 
the coefficients are transformed into probabilities (for binary outcomes) or remain
in their original units (continuous outcomes).
