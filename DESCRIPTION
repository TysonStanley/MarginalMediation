Description: The package provides the ability to perform "Marginal Mediation"--mediation
   wherein the indirect and direct effects is are terms of the average marginal effects (Bartus, 2005). 
   This framework allows the use of categorical mediators and outcomes with little change in interpretation
   from the continuous mediators/outcomes. See <http://tysonbarrett.com/Dissertation> for more details 
   on the method (peer reviewed articles forthcoming). Note that any version less than 1.0.0 is considered beta.
